Got the best sound in the range. A decent battery life. Looks super sleek and stylish. Built quality is good. Very handy in terms of size and grip. Comfortable because of its light weight.  The only con I found is that the touch controls lags a bit. It doesn't work at once sometimes not always. But works for sure and perfectly fine on the second touch. So not such a big issue. Overall the best earbuds for the price.!", "The Buds themselves are very light in weight and well built,but the comfort levels in the ear could have been better.Apart from that slightest flaw I didn't find any major downside In this product.To be honest in this price range shouldn't have asked for better !! The case could have been a bit smaller in size The music sounds flawless !", "I recevied the product in 3 days. It looks classy and build quality was great.

Connects very fast", "Cons: ", "1. It is somewhat difficult to open the case when you are in the dark, like sleeping or in bed, coz u cannot figure out which way is the opening. Its completely symmetrical, and so i have to keep rotating it and try it in every dire...", "Perfect for the price. The case is a little badly made, but works fine. Earbuds are perfect fit. Audio quality, pairing and audio syncing is perfect. For music and videos, it's fine. Not tested for gaming.", "One potential con, but you honestly can't expect any device of this price range to have, but still there's no bluetooth multi-connect. Which means you can't have it be connected to say a phone and laptop simultaneously. Individually it works across multiple devices, but simultaneous connec...", "Pros..I am satisfied with the output I am getting from this ear buds within this price range..not a professional to judge based on strict parameters but get a good balanced bass, clarity with good battery back up which comes with C type charging too...was little sceptical to order but took the decision based on other good reviews as well..", "Cons...it hurts a little with long usage..may need to check changing the right replacement ear bud tips.", "Using this since one month. This earbud is for music only. Build quality is fabulous, looks premium in hand. Bass and sound is good overall. If you listening songs and watching videos or web series battery will not leave you till the series ends. Battery lasts for 4 hrs approx on a single charge. Overall it's a decent earbud in this range. Only con in this is calling. In indoor u can take call but u have to turn off your fan so that other person can hear you. Outdoor calling is way more bad. ..."], "storeProductId": "ACCFTJZ5M8FVGTYH", "storeLink": "https://www.flipkart.com/noise-shots-groove-truly-wireless-bluetooth-headset/p/itm3d355f353adbf?pid=ACCFTJZ5M8FVGTYH&lid=LSTACCFTJZ5M8FVGTYHR3IOKA&marketplace=FLIPKART&srno=s_3_86&otracker=search&fm=organic&iid=f83821ce-ac7b-43db-b5b4-d133376cc8ee.ACCFTJZ5M8FVGTYH.SEARCH&ssid=fkvhzwv6yo0000001598609171768&qH=54597ea1f2fc7f2e", "storeName": "Flipkart", "storePrice": "2,999"}, "category": "electronics", "subcategory": "earphones", "brand": "Noise", "description": {"Model Name": "Shots Groove Truly Wireless", "Color": "Sage Gray", "Headphone Type": "True Wireless", "Inline Remote": "No", "Sales Package": "1 Pair Bluetooth Headphone, 1 Charging Case , 1 Type-C Cable, 2 Extra Eartips, 1 User Manual, 1 Warranty Card", "Connectivity": "Bluetooth", "Headphone Design": "Earbud", "Sweat Proof": "Yes", "Deep Bass": "Yes", "Water Resistant": "Yes", "Driver Type": "Balanced Sound", "Controls": "Volume Control, Call Control, Music Control", "With Microphone": "Yes", "Maximum Power Input": "10 mW", "Minimum Frequency Response": "20 Hz", "Maximum Frequency Response": "20000 Hz", "Audio Codec": "SBC", "Wireless Type": "Bluetooth", "Wireless Range": "10 m", "Bluetooth Profiles": "HSP, HFP, A2DP,AVRCP,SPP", "Bluetooth Version": "5", "Bluetooth Range": "10 m", "Headphone Power Source": "C Type", "Battery Output": "3.7 V", "Battery Type": "Lithium Polymer", "Battery Life": "15 hrs", "Battery Capacity": "300 mAh", "Charging Time": "1.5 Hours", "Play Time": "15 hr", "Standby Time": "30 hr", "Width": "60 mm", "Height": "29.3 mm", "Depth": "60 mm", "Weight": "55", "Domestic Warranty": "1 Year", "Warranty Summary": "1 Year from the date of purchase", "Warranty Service Type": "Email | Support | Contact - help@nexxbase.com | support.gonoise.in | +91 8882132132", "Covered in Warranty": "Warranty is applicable on manufacturing defects for all the products including accessories (If any) for 1 Year from the date of purchase.", "Not Covered in Warranty": "unauthorized tampering, modification or repairs ; physical damage ; water logging or any other damage due to heat, humidity or moisture doing operations"}, "photos": "https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/128/128/kd69z0w0/headphone/y/a/y/shots-groove-truly-wireless-noise-original-imafu4hqvhdqqhky.jpeg?q=70"},
