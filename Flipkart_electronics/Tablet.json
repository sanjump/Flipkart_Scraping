For a student, This is just a blessing. Multitasking is smooth and reading and editing notes is seamless. For pubg lovers, Will run the game on BALANCED settings and EXTREME frame rates with no lag. Enough for some Photo editing also. Go for it. 128gb is good. 32gb is too less as ipadOS apps are big in size. Pubg alone is more than 6gb . Once u start editing and highlighting ur pdf notes their size also leeps on increasing. Will buy apple pencil soon.", "Unless one is sure about its usage, shouldn't invest this much amount.

(9.7 vs 10.2). processor is good for day to day tasks and as usual optimisation is very good as well. Battery life is good too even though it has bigger screen than before. other change is addition of smart keyboard support. It feels little bit heavy in hands, so holding it for long time while in bed will be cumbersome.  I ordered this during diwali offer period so got a very good deal. As usual delivery and pack...", "Best for students. Note making at it's best. Video editing (4k) is manageable but  a bit lagging is expected. Not for professionals. Camera is okay type.

Would recommend to buy the same. Excellent battery life and smoothness of the system but Netflix here consumes more data.", "Great product, good for animation, taking notes, doing schoolwork, etc. Great at gaming too but I recommend ipad mini 5 if want an ipad for gaming.
