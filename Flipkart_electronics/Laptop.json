I recommend to fully upgrade the laptop (software,deivers and windows update).The only thing which i didn't like about this laptop is the volume of the sound , it's really low . You can't hear properly if the room's fan is on.If sound is not a problem for you then it's definitely a buy buy laptop .go for it.", "Best"]},
