Don't buy it for heavy gaming purposes.", "So i was a bit sceptic about the brand before investing on it. However after couple of weeks of use i am assured that this is the best TBook in this range, we cannot compare it with surface as the price is remarkably high for that device. But it does the job.  Pros: Very good battery life. Slick design and sturdy. Touch screen is good and above average performance for daily job (no gaming) no heating issues whatsoever. Boots up in 5 seconds. Bluetooth smooth keyboard with led.
