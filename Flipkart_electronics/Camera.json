Do like my comment if it ...", "I was quite surprised by the delivery speed......got it the very next day.......thanks to flipkart", "This is my first ILC.....was skeptical about the kit lens after watching a lot of reviews, but after using it i feel this lens is best suited for beginners and novice photographers.", "Overall i am pretty happy with the purchase and am planning on including a fast prime with my kit.", "Very good camera especially when u pair it with sigma prime lenses... Solid built quality. Good picture clarity in low light", "As expected awesome experience with thecamera,eye tracking is blazingly fast. Super crispy video from the camera. Raw photos are also looking good. The lens is not that good for portraits.", "wow..amazing", "awesome", "awesome camera best apsc camera in the world", "Great camera overall. Can't go too far with the kit lens. The OSS in the kit lens didn't make much of a difference for slow shutter shots. The real-time face tracking is great. Since it's a new camera, it's hard to get accessories in the Indian market yet."]},

And Sony lenses are very expensive. It's not just a beginner level camera, its more than that, so if you are beginner and have high budget then only go for this camera. It can take amazing shots but you need spend more money in lenses. Kit lens is okay, but I will suggest you 50mm  F/1.8 (or 1.4 if you are rich enough to buy ) lens if you are new to photography.

Solid built quality. Good picture clarity in low light", "As expected awesome experience with thecamera,eye tracking is blazingly fast. Super crispy video from the camera. Raw photos are also looking good. The lens is not that good for portraits.", "wow..amazing", "awesome", "awesome camera best apsc camera in the world", "Great camera overall. Can't go too far with the kit lens. The OSS in the kit lens didn't make much of a difference for slow shutter shots. The real-time face tracking is great.
