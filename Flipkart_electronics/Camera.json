The build quality is great. Feels good in the hand. Lightweight and compact. This comes with the new Digic 8 image processor. And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend.  If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.", "Super camera. Eazy to use. Photos is perfect. 55-250mm super clarity. Both 2 lence is perfect.

Everything is almost as expected from a Canon DSLR. The touch is very sensitive, the camera built is premium, response is fast l thanx to its all latest digic 8 processor.
