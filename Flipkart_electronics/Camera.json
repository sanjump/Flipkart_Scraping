And Sony lenses are very expensive. It's not just a beginner level camera, its more than that, so if you are beginner and have high budget then only go for this camera. It can take amazing shots but you need spend more money in lenses. Kit lens is okay, but I will suggest you 50mm  F/1.8 (or 1.4 if you are rich enough to buy ) lens if you are new to photography.

Cons: no in body stabilizer (like a6500), low battery, lightweight (some ppl prefer heaviness).", "Best Apsc camera in the market period. The thing that distinguish it from competition is the autofocus speed which even far superior than almost 99 camera under 2 lakh.

And Sony lenses are very expensive. It's not just a beginner level camera, its more than that, so if you are beginner and have high budget then only go for this camera. It can take amazing shots but you need spend more money in lenses. Kit lens is okay, but I will suggest you 50mm  F/1.8 (or 1.4 if you are rich enough to buy ) lens if you are new to photography.

Do like my comment if it ...", "I was quite surprised by the delivery speed......got it the very next day.......thanks to flipkart", "This is my first ILC.....was skeptical about the kit lens after watching a lot of reviews, but after using it i feel this lens is best suited for beginners and novice photographers.", "Overall i am pretty happy with the purchase and am planning on including a fast prime with my kit.", "Very good camera especially when u pair it with sigma prime lenses...

Can't go too far with the kit lens. The OSS in the kit lens didn't make much of a difference for slow shutter shots. The real-time face tracking is great.
